# To-do List Project

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.
In this project, Ibuild a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!
I achieved that by using JavaScript arrays and objects. I also dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.
